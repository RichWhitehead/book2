## Author: Richard Whitehead

## Challenge

You have been supplied with two demos, each presenting a key new feature. blogapi-permissions demonstrates how to restrict access to portions of your APIs data. blogapi-postgres demonstrates switching over to using postgres vs sqlite.

## Features - Django REST Framework

•	Make your site a DRF powered API as you did in previous lab.
•	Adjust project’s permissions so that only authenticated user’s have access to API.
•	Add a custom permission so that only author of blog post can update or delete it.
•	Add ability to switch user’s directly from browsable API.
